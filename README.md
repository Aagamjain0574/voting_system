# Sentiment-Based Voting System

This project is a blockchain-based voting system that dynamically assigns votes based on real-time sentiment analysis. The system is automated and ensures unbiased voting by relying on sentiment scores.

## Features

- **Automated Voting:** Determines votes based on sentiment scores.
- **Three Candidates:** Users can vote for Alice, Bob, or Charlie based on sentiment trends.
- **Sentiment-Based Decision:** If the sentiment score is positive, Alice receives the vote; if negative, Bob receives it; if neutral, Charlie is chosen.
- **Secure & Transparent:** Built on Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
- **Owner Controls:** The contract owner can update sentiment scores and close voting when necessary.

## Deployed Contract

- **Blockchain:** Edu Chain
- **Contract Address:** `0x828B5403e2e23653d05626980651903fCF864310`

## How It Works

1. The contract owner updates the sentiment score based on external analysis.
2. Users vote, and the contract assigns votes dynamically.
3. Voting can be closed by the owner to finalize results.

This smart contract ensures a fair and transparent voting process without human bias.
